added here something to test windows bash
* add better error handling when mapping doesn't work
* tables needs hdf5 dependencies
* some git repositories are difficult to access
* each time the mapping function finishes it should check whether the currently running mapping is the
last one and if so then once this is done it should delete all unnecessary files
